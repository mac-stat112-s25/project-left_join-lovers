Title: How to Make Teamwork Effective for Success

**Summary**
- Continuous recognition of good *team* performance. Using words such as "we", "us", and "ours" is better than using "I", "me", or "mine."
- Outcomes must be clearly defined.
- Team members must have confidence in the metrics used to measure success/ completion of certain tasks.
