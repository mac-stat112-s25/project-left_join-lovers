#Case Study
**Source**
*Text analysis of Trump's tweets confirms he writes only the (angrier) Android half* article from "Variance Explained"

**Observations**
- In this article, we are looking at the difference between tweets from Trump that come from Android vs iPhone. 
- The article begins with photos/ examples of the tweets.
- During the results section of the article, the progression goes: code to visualization to discusssion/ analysis of the graphs. 
- In the actual code, we see examples of classic wrangling such as strings, joins, and the 5 most common verbs (such as filter, select, etc). Effective visualization is also applied: clearly labeled axes, color-blindness friendly palate. There is consistent labeling of the code using #.
