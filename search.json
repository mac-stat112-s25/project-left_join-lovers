    "text": "Introduction\nIn the modern dating scene, the swipe has become a symbol of possibility, rejection, and everything in between. But behind every swipe lies a data point—a reflection of who we are, what we seek, and how our identities shape our digital interactions. This study uses data from a dating app to explore deeper behavioral patterns based on gender, sexual orientation, education4 , income and location.\nWhy do some users become more “addicted” to dating apps? How do identity and geography intersect with digital romance? And what can these patterns tell us about the broader social experience and interaction of dating in the digital age?",

    "text": "Analysis\nGender Identity\nWe begin with a broad view of how gender identity intersects with app usage levels.\n\nCodedating_app_data |&gt;\n  mutate(app_usage_time_label = fct_relevel(app_usage_time_label,\n            \"Addicted\", \"Extreme User\", \"High\", \"Moderate\", \"Barely\", \"Low\", \"Very Low\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(y = gender, fill = app_usage_time_label)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(fill = \"Usage\", y = \"Gender\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"magma\") +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first plot reveals that across all gender identities, the largest usage category is Extreme User. This suggests that intense engagement is a platform-wide phenomenon—dating apps are designed to retain attention across the board (Alter, 2017).\nBut diving into just the Addicted group uncovers something more specific:\n\nCodedating_app_data |&gt;\n  filter(app_usage_time_label == \"Addicted\") |&gt;\n  group_by(gender) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n()) |&gt;\nggplot(aes(y = gender, x = count, fill = gender)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"magma\") +\n  labs(y=\"Gender\", fill=\"Gender\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, Non-binary (NB) users and those who Prefer Not to Say (PNTS) are the most represented. This is a striking finding and may reflect the fact that NB and PNTS users often find more inclusive spaces online than offline, leading to increased app engagement (Miller, 2015). Dating apps may act as rare safe zones for connection, identity exploration, and validation.\nSexual Orientation\nFocusing now on NB and PNTS users, we examine how sexual orientation affects app usage time.\n\nCodedating_app_data |&gt;\n  filter(app_usage_time_label == \"Addicted\",\n         gender %in% c(\"Non-binary\", \"Prefer Not to Say\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = app_usage_time_min,\n             fill = sexual_orientation,\n             alpha = 0.2))+\n  facet_wrap(~sexual_orientation)+\n  geom_density()+\n  theme_minimal()+ \n  labs (title = \"Distribution of App Usage by Sexual Orientation for NB and PNTS Users\", \n        x = \"Time Spent on App\", \n        y = \"Density\", \n        fill = \"Sexual Orientation\")+ \n  guides(alpha = \"none\")+\n  scale_fill_viridis_d()    \n\n\n\nA density visualization depicting the relationship between time spent on app sexual orientation for the gender identities that had the highest rates of “addicted” users as per our analysis with the gender identity factor.\n\n\n\nThese plots show that Straight and Queer users within NB/PNTS categories peak in app usage between 55–165 minutes. The peaks reflect substantial engagement, possibly driven by the limited dating options in offline settings for these orientations (LeFebvre, 2018).\nTo test this further, we categorize users as Straight vs. Non-Straight:\n\nCodedating_app_data |&gt;\n  filter( gender %in% c(\"Non-binary\", \"Prefer Not to Say\")) |&gt;\n   mutate(straight = str_detect(sexual_orientation, \"Straight\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = app_usage_time_min,\n             fill = straight,\n             alpha = 0.5))+\n  geom_density()+\n  theme_minimal()+ \n  labs (title = \"Distribution of App Usage by (Non)Straight NB and PNTS Users\", \n        x = \"Time Spent on App\", \n        y = \"Density\",\n        fill = \"User Identifies as Straight\")+ \n  guides(alpha = \"none\")+\n  scale_fill_viridis_d()    \n\n\n\nA density plot that demonstrates the density of straight vs nonstraight non-binary and “prefer not to say” users as per the minutes they spend on the dating app.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, Straight users within NB/PNTS groups show a second peak around 200 minutes, suggesting a higher dependency or reliance on the app. This could stem from marginalization within both queer and heteronormative spaces, leading to prolonged searching or browsing behavior.\nWhat About Binary Genders?\nHow do these patterns play out among binary gender groups?\n\nCode#How does this relationship change if we look at users that identify as male?\n#| fig-cap: A density plot depicting the time usage in minutes of male, straight and male, non-straight users on the dating app.\n#| fig-alt: A density plot depicting the time usage in minutes of male, straight and male, non-straight users on the dating app..\n\ndating_app_data |&gt;\n  filter(gender == \"Male\") |&gt;\n   mutate(straight = str_detect(sexual_orientation, \"Straight\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = app_usage_time_min,\n             fill = straight,\n             alpha = 0.5))+\n  geom_density()+\n  theme_minimal()+ \n  labs (title = \"App Usage by (Non)Straight Male Users\", \n        x = \"Time Spent on App\", \n        y = \"Density\",\n        fill = \"User Identifies as Straight\") + \n  guides(alpha = \"none\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d()   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor male users, Straight individuals spend slightly more time on the app (peak at ~180 mins), possibly due to cultural norms around men being expected to initiate conversations or compete for attention.\n\nCodedating_app_data |&gt;\n  filter(gender == \"Female\") |&gt;\n   mutate(straight = str_detect(sexual_orientation, \"Straight\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = app_usage_time_min,\n             fill = straight,\n             alpha = 0.5))+\n  geom_density()+\n  theme_minimal()+ \n  labs (title = \"App Usage by (Non)Straight Female Users\", \n        x = \"Time Spent on App\", \n        y = \"Density\",\n        fill = \"User Identifies as Straight\")+ \n  guides(alpha = \"none\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() \n\n\n\nA density plot depicting the time usage in minutes of female, straight vs female, non-straight users on the dating app.\n\n\n\nAmong female users, non-straight individuals spend more time on the app, especially past the 150-minute mark. This is may be due to the fact that non-straight female users consistently outnumber straight female users beginning at 150 minutes.\nLocation\nDoes where you live change how you date?\n\nCodelibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\nCodedating_app_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/dating_app_behavior_dataset.csv\")\n\n\n\nCodedating_app_data |&gt;\n  group_by(location_type) |&gt;\n  summarise(location_mean_usage = mean(app_usage_time_min, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(location_type, -location_mean_usage), \n             y = location_mean_usage, \n             fill = location_type)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"magma\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average App Usage Time by Location Type\",\n    subtitle = \"Mean usage time in minutes per location category\",\n    x = \"Location Type\",\n    y = \"Average Usage Time (minutes)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers in metro areas spend significantly more time on dating apps than those in suburban or remote areas. Urban life may facilitate higher engagement due to higher acceptance of app-based dating (Smith & Duggan, 2013).\nWhen comparing average usage time:\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(dating_app_data, aes(x = location_type, y = mutual_matches, fill = location_type)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"magma\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Mutual Matches Across Location Types\",\n    subtitle = \"Boxplot showing variation in mutual match counts by location category\",\n    x = \"Location Type\",\n    y = \"Mutual Matches\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetro users consistently lead, reinforcing the idea that urban environments foster more digital dating activity whether due to convenience or social norms. This also could possibly be due to greater social interaction or availability of matches which further supports the idea that people in more densely populated areas tend to engage with dating apps more frequently.\nWho’s Really Matching?\n[insert plot here]\nOur final plot examines mutual matches across location types. Again, metro users have more variability and higher maximum matches, suggesting greater chances of success in densely populated areas. The opposite is also true for users in remote areas who appear to have more concentrated and lower values for mutual matches, which suggests a potentially smaller dating pool or fewer interactions.\nAlternative Explanations\nWhile the data tells a compelling story, alternative interpretations should be considered:\n\nAlgorithmic bias may favor urban or frequently active users.\nSocial isolation in remote areas or among NB/PNTS users may drive higher app engagement.\nPsychological dependency like fear of missing out or gamification—may inflate time spent regardless of real connection.",

    "text": "Building Effective Teams - 5 Actions For Team Leaders\n\n\nThe Atlassian article “The Importance of Teamwork (As Proven by Science)” explores how effective teamwork not only enhances organizational success but also contributes significantly to individual well-being. Here are the key takeaways:\n\n\n5.0.1 🔍 Key Benefits of Teamwork\n\nEnhanced Problem Solving Collaborative efforts lead to superior outcomes. Research indicates that groups of three to five individuals outperform even the most capable solo performers in tasks requiring problem-solving and decision-making. This is attributed to the collective ability to generate, evaluate, and adopt effective solutions while discarding less viable ones.\nFostering Innovation Through Risk-Taking Team environments encourage individuals to take calculated risks, knowing they have the support of their peers. This collective backing fosters a culture where innovative ideas can flourish without the fear of failure.\nPersonal Growth and Development Working within a team exposes individuals to diverse perspectives and feedback, promoting self-awareness and personal development. Team members can learn from each other’s experiences, leading to improved skills and personal growth.\nIncreased Job Satisfaction and Reduced Stress Being part of a supportive team can lead to higher job satisfaction and lower stress levels. The shared responsibilities and mutual support inherent in teamwork contribute to a more fulfilling work experience.\n\n\n\n\n5.0.2 💡 Practical Tips for Effective Teamwork\n\nEncourage Diverse Input: Recognize that team members process information differently. Providing opportunities for both immediate and reflective contributions ensures inclusive participation.\nPromote Psychological Safety: Create an environment where team members feel safe to express ideas and take risks without fear of negative consequences.\nFacilitate Open Communication: Encourage honest and transparent communication to build trust and understanding within the team.\n\n\nIn summary, the article underscores that effective teamwork is a cornerstone of both organizational success and individual well-being. By fostering collaboration, encouraging risk-taking, and promoting personal growth, teams can achieve remarkable outcomes that extend beyond mere productivity.",

distribution across categories, which, while not entirely realistic, allows for more reliable analysis.\nThis dataset allows for unique analysis of digital intimacy trends in a controlled environment. The balance across demographics suggests that the Kaggle user who uploaded these wanted an intentional design for analysis, which may not truly mirror real-world dating ecosystems–which are shaped by structural inequalities, algorithmic biases, and cultural expectations. It’s important for us as a group to keep this in mind as we do both our EDA and the entire project as a wholel. That this is fully simulated data, while useful for pattern recognition, can obscure the lived experiences of users on actual platforms—especially those from marginalized communities: like the LGBTQ+ community which a majority of our project hinges upon.\nSince the data is simulated, it is a note of interest as to how we can compare it to actual dating app experiences.",

However, for date happened, blocked, or mutual match, those who preferred not to say had more of those outcomes.\nWe can also look at men vs. women for app outcomes as follows:\n\nCodedating_app_data |&gt;\n  filter(gender == c(\"Male\", \"Female\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(y=match_outcome, fill = gender)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")",

    "text": "Francesca LoPresti, Maren Stewart-Tanner, Providence Thusabantu, El Davis-Greene, David Manguluti\nDemographics and Dating Apps: How User Interaction Varies by Group in Simulated Dating Software\nData:\nDating App Behavior Dataset (Kaggle - This is a synthetic dataset generated programmatically. It does not contain real user data and is intended for educational and analytical purposes only.)\nShort description of project:\nIn this project, we will be examining user data information for a simulated dating app. This data set examines 19 aspects of how users interact with or display themselves on the dating app, including gender, sexual orientation, income level, interest tags, and more. In the preset research, we will focus on how the demographic factors provided (gender, sexual orientation, income level, education, location, etc) impact the mentalities and actions that users approach the dating app with. Our research questions are varied, but among them are the following: How does your sexual orientation impact your dating app mentality; What are the most influential demographic factors in determining a user’s dependency; How does education level impact the swipe right ratio or swipe right label? Additionally we will examine how self-reported interests may also have an impact on the users’ interactions with the app. We will use RStudio to create visualizations to examine these questions and generate visualizations that aid in the understanding of these data.\nPossible research questions:\n\nHow does your sexual orientation impact your dating app mentality? General attitude by sexual orientation\n\n- Color/ facet with app usage time?\n\nWhat are the most influential demographic factors in determining a user’s dependency (as quantified by minutes (either numbers or categorical brackets) spent on a dating app)?\n\n- Geographic (urban/suburban/rural)\n- Class\n- Education\n\nA combination of those factors? Ie low-income urban vs low-income rural?\nWhat can this tell us about the “connectedness” of certain communities?\nWhat is the most common interest tag?\nWhat interest tag is most linked to high app dependence (ie in the “extreme user,” “high,” and “addicted” brackets?)\nHow does location (i.e. remote area, metro, etc) impact app dependence?\nHow does education level impact the swipe right ratio or swipe right label?\nAre there gender-based differences in dating app behavior and expectations?\nWhat are the most common behaviors among frequent vs. infrequent users?\n\nReason/ inspiration behind choosing the topic:\nIn recent years, dating apps have transformed how people form romantic and social connections. With technology playing an increasingly central role in our personal lives, understanding user behavior on these platforms provides valuable insight into modern relationship dynamics, preferences, and societal trends. We chose the Dating App Behavior Dataset because it has a mix of both quantitative and qualitative variables that we think can be used to study behavior. Our goal is to identify relationships and understand how they differ between different groups of people. Lastly, this topic is relatable to a lot of people with the increase in online dating.",
